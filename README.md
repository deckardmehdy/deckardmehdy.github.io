Hi everyone! This is a repository for my projects. To view them, click the links below:
* **Color Game** (*HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*): This is an interactive game that tests a player's knowledge of RGB values. An RGB value is defined as RGB(red, blue, green). Each parameter defines the intensity of the respective color as an integer between 0 and 255, where 255 is the maximum intensity. To play, you select a square that you think has a color matching the RGB value posted at the top of the page. You keep playing until the right square has been found!

* **iPath** (*HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery*): This is a visualizer that can demonstrate how different pathfinding algorithms work. The program's objective is to go from the top left-hand corner to the bottom right-hand corner of the board. The user can draw walls (i.e. the gray cells) to create a maze for the algorithm to go through. Once the algorithm has found the right path, it will be illuminated in yellow. There are currently three algorithms that can be utilized: breadth-first search, depth-first search, and dijkstra.
